# Threat Model for Access Control System

## Introduction
This document outlines the threat model for the Access Control System. It identifies potential security threats and describes the countermeasures implemented to mitigate these threats.

## System Overview
The Access Control System is a Flask-based web application that provides authentication, role-based access control, user management, and profile management functionalities. It is designed to be used by small organizations to control access to their resources.

## STRIDE Threat Analysis

### Spoofing
- **Threat**: Attackers may attempt to impersonate legitimate users.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Strong password hashing using bcrypt
  - Password complexity requirements
  - Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
  - Session management with proper timeout
  - CSRF protection for all forms

### Tampering
- **Threat**: Unauthorized modification of data.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Role-based access control for all routes
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - CSRF protection to prevent request forgery
  - Audit logging for all important actions
  - Database constraints and validation

### Repudiation
- **Threat**: Users deny performing an action without the ability to verify.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Comprehensive audit logging
  - Logging authentication attempts (success/failure)
  - Recording IP addresses for sensitive actions
  - Timestamping all actions
  - Documenting administrative actions

### Information Disclosure
- **Threat**: Exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Role-based access control
  - Password hashing (never storing plaintext)
  - Secure password reset mechanism
  - Cache control headers for sensitive pages
  - Error handling to prevent information leakage
  - Content Security Policy headers

### Denial of Service
- **Threat**: Making the system unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Rate limiting on login attempts
  - Account lockout mechanism
  - Input validation to prevent resource-intensive attacks
  - Database query optimization
  - Session management controls

### Elevation of Privilege
- **Threat**: Gaining unauthorized privileges or accessing unauthorized resources.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Strict role-based access control at both UI and server levels
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Parameterized database queries to prevent SQL injection
  - Session validation and protection
  - Route protection with role decorators

## Security Controls Implementation

### Authentication Security
- Password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate cost factor
- Password complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes
- Password change history to prevent reuse
- Secure password reset functionality with time-limited tokens

### Session Security
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Session regeneration on login
- Secure cookie settings
- CSRF protection for all forms
- Cache control headers for sensitive pages

### Input Validation
- Form validation using WTForms
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Parameterized database queries to prevent SQL injection

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all routes
- Admin-only actions properly protected
- User management features (create, edit, delete) restricted to admin role
- Profile management restricted to the user's own profile

### Audit Logging
- Authentication events (login success/failure)
- Administrative actions (user creation, modification, deletion)
- Password changes and reset requests
- IP address logging for security analysis

### Error Handling
- Custom error pages
- Sanitized error messages to users
- Detailed internal error logging without information leakage

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- No defense against sophisticated brute force attacks
- Limited protection against distributed denial of service attacks
- No automated security scanning integration
- No real-time threat monitoring

### Planned Enhancements
- Two-factor authentication
- IP-based access restrictions
- Integration with breach notification services
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Automated backup system
- Security headers enhancement
